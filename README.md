# <a name="lat">Introduction</a>

This purpose of this project was to write code that creates a dynamic table which updates UFO sightings based on user input. 

# <a name="search">Automatic Table and Date Search</a>

- Created an HTML web page named index.html

- Using the UFO dataset provided in the form of an array of JavaScript objects, I wrote code that appends a table to the web page and adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting.

- Used a date form in the HTML document and wrote JavaScript code that listens for events and searches through the date/time column to find rows that match user input.

- 'No Data Found' message will appear when there is no data found for the search criteria
